This report captures the successful conclusion of a demanding academic journey undertaken by our learners, made possible through their commitment and perseverance, as well as the steadfast support\nof teachers, families and communities nationwide. Confronted by a dynamic and demanding year, the 2025 cohort rose with courage and purpose, reaffirming our belief in the transformative power of education and the bright future it continues to shape.\nThis report is one of a series of reports produced by the Department of Basic Education that encapsulates the performance of the Class of 2025 that started schooling in Grade R in 2013 with dreams and aspirations of being the best they can.\nHowever, in 2020, when they were in Grade 7, the last year of their primary schooling, they were\ndealt a harsh blow with the advent of Covid-19. This not only disrupted their schooling programme ESAGE severely, but they had to deal with the trauma associated with Covid-19. Besides having to cope with school closure, they were subjected to reduced teaching exposure when schools re-opened, and a condensed curriculum. This class therefore were not fully prepared to deal with the transition from primary schooling to secondary schooling. Despite these major impediments, the Class of 2025 demonstrated immense resilience and fortitude and this will be confirmed in the account presented in this comprehensive report.\nThe Department has undertaken to produce a series of reports which will provide the different levels in the system with in-depth information on the performance of the Class of 2025. This School Performance Report which provides the overall performance of the individual schools across the province, district and the circuit will be a valuable tool for provincial planners, school managers, school principals and subject advisors. The overall performance of the school is also compared to the last two years so as to identify schools that are showing improvement and those that are not. This Report will be used to monitor and support the schools moving forward.\nAs we close this chapter and look to the road ahead, we are reminded that the true legacy of the National Senior Certificate lies not only in certificates awarded, but in minds empowered and futures transformed. Thuto e matla ho feta tshepe \u2013 education is stronger than iron, stronger than any weapon \u2013 because it shapes conscience, unlocks possibility and builds nations without destroying them. In the achievements of the Class of 2025, we see proof that when education is protected, nurtured and made accessible to all, it becomes South Africa\u2019s most enduring force for justice, progress and shared prosperity.\nWe thank our parents, teachers and all our partners in education for your unflinching support during this thirteen-year journey of the Class of 2025. To our learners, this is not the end of the journey but it is just a pause moment to reflect on the road travelled and to recharge and strengthen your resolve for the road ahead.\nIt is my earnest request that this School Performance Report be used meaningfully by all in the schooling ecosystem.\n    1. INTRODUCTION\nThe overall results of the 6 950 schools and examination centres that participated in the 2025 National Senior Certificate (NSC) examination have been consolidated into a national report. This report serves as a valuable tool for school managers and officials at national, provincial, and district levels, enabling them to thoroughly analyse learner performance data. Detailed school-level data is available within each of the 75 districts, reflecting the number of candidates who sat the examination and the number who successfully obtained the NSC in 2025.\n\nAll school communities are encouraged to engage actively with this data, allowing for reflection on their performance in the 2025 NSC examination. Schools are urged to compare this year\u2019s results with those of previous years to assess progress and identify areas for improvement. This process will facilitate the identification of strategies and interventions that can be integrated into the school programme to achieve tangible and measurable improvements in the upcoming academic year. Additionally, schools within the same quintile are encouraged to compare their historical performance with that of other schools in the same quintile over the past three years. This will provide insights into whether the efforts and resources invested by the education system have led to better outcomes and a more motivated school community. Schools will also have the opportunity to share best practices and form collaborative clusters for mutual benefit.\n\nThis report should be read alongside the following complementary documents published by the Department of Basic Education:\n\n        \u25e6 The 2025 National Senior Certificate Examination Report": null, "\n        \u25e6 The National Schools Subjects Report, which presents performance trends for each subject over the past three years": null, "\n        \u25e6 The National Diagnostic Reports, which analyse learner performance in the 11 Gateway Subjects, the 12 Home Languages, and Technical Subjects, highlighting areas of underperformance and recommending appropriate remedial actions.\nTogether, these reports provide a comprehensive overview of learner, school, and subject performance in the 2025 NSC examination.\n\n\n    2. SCOPE OF THE SCHOOL PERFORMANCE REPORT\nThis report presents data on the performance of all schools that participated in the 2025 National Senior Certificate (NSC) Examination, including public schools, special schools, and independent schools. It also provides an overview of the overall performance of these institutions over a three- year period, enabling schools to assess and track their performance across this timeframe.\n\n2025 marks the twelfth year of the CAPS-aligned NSC Examination, allowing schools to compare their historical performance within a stabilised curriculum and assessment policy framework. This continuity enables schools to evaluate whether they have achieved stability in the effective implementation of the intended curriculum.\n\nThe report includes detailed information on the number of candidates who wrote the examination, the number of candidates who achieved the NSC, and the pass percentage for each school over the last three years. Additionally, it highlights schools that achieved a 100% pass rate as well as those that obtained a pass rate below 40% over a five-year period, providing valuable insights for performance analysis and improvement planning.\n    3. USE OF THE SCHOOL PERFORMANCE REPORT\nThis report is an essential resource for school managers, subject advisors, curriculum specialists, and district planners, offering a comprehensive tool for conducting a comparative analysis of the overall performance of schools within a circuit, cluster, or district. The data it presents allows each school to monitor its progress over time, facilitating the comparison of current performance with results from previous years. This enables institutions to evaluate the impact of past strategies and to pinpoint areas requiring innovation or adjustment for the coming school year.\n\nWith 2025 marking the twelfth year of the NSC examination aligned with the CAPS curriculum, schools have the opportunity to track their performance across three full years of stable assessment and curriculum implementation. This longitudinal data is invaluable in helping schools assess how well they have adapted to the CAPS framework and whether their academic strategies are yielding the desired outcomes.\n\nMoreover, this report provides critical insights for education officials, enabling them to identify schools that have consistently underperformed over multiple years. Such data is instrumental in shaping targeted support programmes, ensuring that support and resources are directed where they are most needed. Schools that continue to struggle with performance must take a proactive approach to reflect on their practices and consider fundamental changes to improve learner outcomes. This reflection should focus on identifying gaps in teaching, learning, and resource allocation, while also considering the adoption of new strategies or methodologies.\n\nThis report not only serves as a tool for measuring individual school progress but also as a guide for fostering collaboration, identifying areas for targeted support, and ultimately driving educational improvement across the broader school community. It encourages all stakeholders to engage with the data thoughtfully, use it as a catalyst for positive change, and contribute to the ongoing enhancement of the education system.\n\n    4.
